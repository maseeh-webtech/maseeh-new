# Maseeh Website

## Design goals

- Simplicity: it should be as easy as possible to get the site up and running for development. Similarly,
- Performance: because high performance makes a site much, much more enjoyable to use.

## Getting started

The recommended development setup is to just run `npm install`, then `npm start` in both the `/client` and `/server` directories. This should spin up hotloaders that watch for changes in the respective directories, and serve the website frontend at `localhost:8080`.
